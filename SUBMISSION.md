# Submission Guide for Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025

This document outlines what you need to submit for the hackathon.

---

## 📋 Submission Requirements

### 1. ✅ Application Built with Required Tools

**Status**: ✅ Complete

- Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- Uses Chrome Built-in AI APIs:
  - ✅ Prompt API (multimodal audio input)
  - ✅ Summarizer API
  - ✅ Writer API
  - ✅ Translator API
  - ✅ Proofreader/Rewriter API

### 2. 📝 Text Description

**What to include**:

#### Features and Functionality

> Meeting Intelligence is a Chrome Extension that transforms how professionals handle virtual meetings. The extension provides:
>
> 1. **Live Meeting Transcription**: Captures tab audio and transcribes in real-time using the Prompt API's multimodal audio input capabilities
> 2. **Smart Summarization**: Generates meeting summaries in multiple formats (key points, TL;DR, headlines) using the Summarizer API
> 3. **Action Item Extraction**: Automatically identifies and formats tasks and decisions using the Writer API
> 4. **Multilingual Support**: Translates meeting transcripts to different languages using the Translator API
> 5. **Grammar Correction**: Polishes meeting notes before sharing using the Proofreader/Rewriter API
> 6. **Meeting History**: Stores and searches past meetings locally
> 7. **Privacy-First Design**: All processing happens on-device using Gemini Nano

#### APIs Used

> This extension showcases all five major Chrome Built-in AI APIs:
>
> - **Prompt API (with multimodal audio input)**: Converts meeting audio to text in real-time, demonstrating the new audio input capability
> - **Summarizer API**: Generates concise summaries with configurable types (key-points, tldr, headline) and lengths
> - **Writer API**: Extracts and formats action items from meeting transcripts into structured markdown checklists
> - **Translator API**: Translates transcripts to support international teams (English, Spanish, Japanese)
> - **Proofreader API (Rewriter)**: Corrects grammar and polishes meeting notes for professional sharing

#### Problem Being Solved

> **The Problem**: Professionals attend countless virtual meetings daily, but valuable information gets lost. Key decisions fade from memory, action items are forgotten, international teams struggle with language barriers, and there's no easy way to review what was discussed. Existing cloud-based solutions raise privacy concerns by exposing sensitive meeting content to external servers.
>
> **The Solution**: Meeting Intelligence solves these problems with privacy-first, on-device AI that:
> - Captures and transcribes meetings without sending data to external servers
> - Extracts actionable insights automatically (summaries, tasks, decisions)
> - Supports multilingual teams with instant translation
> - Works completely offline after initial setup
> - Costs nothing to use (no API fees or quotas)
> - Maintains consistent performance regardless of network conditions
>
> By leveraging Chrome's Built-in AI, we deliver hyper-personalized meeting assistance with guaranteed privacy - user input never leaves the device.
